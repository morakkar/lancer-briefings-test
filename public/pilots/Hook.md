``Let me tell you a little about myself to hep facilitate a better work enviroment. I enjoy walking through the ship to see the state with my own sensors. Please do not knock over my casket, or in more polite terms: fuck about and find out. You are free to enjoy media with me within Cargo Hold 2, but ear filtration will be needed as some of the require metadata is high pitch and intensity. If there is something you require from The Omninet, I have already downloaded it and stored it onto your cabin's entertainment unit. If you want me to databomb some nerd, I'm also down to clown.``
